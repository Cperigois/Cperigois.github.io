To introduce my research work, I propose to integrate it into three broader popular presentations that will allow for an 
evaluation of the general context of the projects I have had the pleasure of conducting throughout my career. You will find three research pages:

- Gravitational waves and their detection 
- The origins of black holes
- ??

On this first page, I introduce gravitational waves with the aim of presenting my research work and the projects I have 
had the pleasure of participating in.


## An historical introduction

Gravitational waves are disturbances in spacetime that propagate at the speed of light. They are a direct consequence of 
Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity and his collaborators, submitted in 1915, in the form of two main papers:
[“On the general theory of relativity”](https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol6-trans/110)  and ["The Field Equations of Gravitation"](https://einsteinpapers.press.princeton.edu/vol6-trans/129). The first publication 
formalizing gravitational waves [“Über Gravitationswellen”](https://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/get_file?pdfs/SPAW./1918/1918SPAW.......154E.pdf) , came three years later.

In 1974, Russell Hulse and Joseph Taylor discovered the binary pulsar PSR B1913+16, which is a system of two objects in orbit, 
one of which is a pulsar that emits a pulse of light at regular intervals. In 1979, after four years of monitoring the 
characteristics of the system, Hulse and Taylor demonstrated that the evolution of the system's orbit perfectly reproduces 
the predictions of gravitational theory for a binary system ([Link to the publication](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1979Natur.277..437T/abstract).
This discovery earned them a Nobel Prize in 1993. The most recent publication to date (2016) that catalogs these measurements 
is freely accessible at this link:  : [Last publication from 2016](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...829...55W/abstract)

The first direct detection of gravitational waves occurred in 2015—the 100th anniversary of general relativity. Using the LIGO detectors, scientists observed the collision of two black holes, one with 29 times the mass of the Sun and the other with 36 times the Sun’s mass.([Lien vers l'article](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016PhRvD..93l2003A/abstract))

Starting in 2017, during the second data-taking phase (O2), the European detector joined the American network, enabling signal triangulation to locate the sources of gravitational waves. On August 17, 2017, the new network observed a merger of two neutron stars 
simultaneously with electromagnetic waves.([Lien vers la publication](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017PhRvL.119p1101A/abstract), 
[Lien vers l'article de la détection multimessagère](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...848L..12A/abstract). This marked the birth of multimessenger astronomy—the creation of an interdisciplinary community enabling the observation of astrophysical phenomena through different cosmic messengers: electromagnetic waves, cosmic rays, neutrinos, and gravitational waves.

Also in 2017, the groundbreaking work behind the first detection, GW150914, was honored with a Nobel Prize.

As of this writing (2025), the gravitational-wave detector network comprises four instruments: two in the U.S., one in Italy, and one in Japan. The scientific community has now recorded over a hundred black hole mergers, providing astrophysicists with invaluable data on the history and evolution of the universe.
